Here is my new ML Project based on Stock price of S and P.

#Programming Language: Python
#IDE: VSCode
#Dataset: Sand P500.csv (Kaggle.com)

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the stock prices of S&P 500 companies using various machine learning models and data analysis techniques. These techniques will be helpful in understanding the behavior of S&P stock prices and how different factors like industry, currentprice, revenue growth.

Basic Operations performed: 
Calculate the important values of Mean, median, Mode
1. Mean- The average Value of the current price, 
2. Median- The midpoint value of the current price, 
3. Mode: The most common value of the current price  
4. Standard Deviation: A number that describes how spread out the values of the current price.

Findings and interpretations
Machine Learning Models
Linear regression. Lets check if there is a positive relation between Current price and Marketcap. The low r squared valued 0.0437 indicated that marketcap may not be a strong interpreter of the current price.

Polynomial Regression: The r2 score is 0.02 which means the polynimial regression also states that marketcap may not be a strong interpreter of the current price.
